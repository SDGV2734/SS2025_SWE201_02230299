# Password Authentication in Expo with supabase

## WHAT I HAVE DONE

In this project, I implemented a user authentication system using Expo for the front-end mobile application and Supabase for the back-end authentication service. The app allows users to sign up and log in securely using their email and password. I integrated Supabase’s authentication features within the Expo app using JavaScript and Supabase’s client library. The flow included proper input validation, error handling, and UI feedback for a smooth user experience.

## WHAT I HAVE LEARNT
- How to set up and configure Supabase for a new project.

- How to use Supabase client functions such as signUp and signInWithPassword for handling authentication.

- How to use React Native components within Expo to build user-friendly login and registration forms.

- Managing user authentication state and protecting routes/screens based on login status.

- Debugging techniques when working with asynchronous functions and API responses.


## WHAT CHALLENGES I HAVE FACED
 - Understanding the Supabase client setup and initializing it correctly in an Expo environment.

- Handling authentication errors, such as incorrect credentials or existing accounts during registration.

- Managing loading states and ensuring smooth UI feedback (e.g., showing activity indicators during login/signup).

- Dealing with navigation issues, like redirecting users properly after login or logout.

##  HOW DID I OVERCOME
- I referred to the official Supabase and Expo documentation, which helped me understand the correct integration flow.

- I used console logs and alerts to trace issues during the development phase.

- I tested various edge cases and implemented error messages to improve user experience.

- I used React context to manage authentication state across different screens and ensured secure access based on that state.
